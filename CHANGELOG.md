- ✨ **UI/UX Enhancements**:
    - **Right-Click Context Menus**: Access quick actions for songs, playlists, and genres (share, download, show cover art).
    - **Advanced Mouse Wheel Controls**: Use the mouse wheel to adjust playback rate and crossfade duration, in addition to volume and progress.

    - **Natural Sorting**: Lists are sorted intelligently, correctly handling numbers in names (e.g., "Playlist 2" before "Playlist 10").

    - **"Friends' Music" Links**: Add and access a list of links to your friends' music players directly from the UI.

    - **Cover Art Shine**: A glossy shine effect on cover art when hovering.

    - **Header/Footer Effects**: An animated underline for the main title and a glowing footer border during playback.
    - **Custom Lyrics View**: A retro-style lyrics display with a monospace font and custom scrollbar.
- ⚙️ **System & Configuration**:
    - **Automatic Update Checks**: The player periodically checks for new versions in the background.
    - **Real-time WebSocket Notifications**: Receive instant alerts for library updates and when lyrics are found, without needing to reload.
    - **Grouped Settings UI**: Server settings are now organized into logical groups like General, Library, and Performance for easier management.
- 🎵 **Backend & Internals**:
    - **Dependency Checker**: On startup, the server verifies that all required system dependencies (Perl modules and external commands like `file`, `eyeD3`) are present, ensuring stability and providing clear error messages on failure.
    - **Port Conflict Prevention**: The server intelligently checks if its configured port is already in use and prevents a second instance from running, avoiding conflicts.
    - **Non-Blocking Library Scan**: The music library is scanned asynchronously in chunks, allowing the server to be responsive immediately at startup, even with massive music collections.
    - **Advanced Filter Logic**: When combining filters (e.g., a playlist and a genre), the server performs a true intersection of the sets, enabling precise and powerful music discovery.
    - **Hierarchical Lyrics Engine**: The system uses a sophisticated multi-step process to find lyrics: it first checks its local cache, then performs a deep scan of the audio file's metadata (checking `eyeD3`, multiple ID3v2 tag frames, and `exiftool`), and only then searches multiple online providers as a last resort.
    - **Resilient Online Fetching**: The online lyrics search is built for robustness, with fallbacks to multiple providers, temporary blacklisting of failing services, and intelligent URL variations to maximize success.
- 🛡️ **Security**:
    - **Multi-Layer File Access Security**: Every request for an audio file is validated through a chain of security checks, including preventing path traversal, blocking malicious characters, ensuring the file is within a whitelisted directory, and verifying its MIME type to serve only legitimate audio.
- 📱 **Mobile UX Refinements**:
    - **Persistent Cover Art State**: Remembers if you've hidden the fullscreen mobile cover art.
    - **Dynamic Sidebar Visibility**: Sidebars auto-hide during search on mobile to maximize screen space.
- 🛠 **Dropdown Clipping Fix**: Removed `overflow-hidden` from main container to stop dropdowns being cut off by content area.

- 📻 **Radio Playback Stability**: Reset autoplay flags and source to ensure reliable radio stream playback after reloads.

- ⏳ **Radio Stream UI Improvements**: Show infinite duration and hide progress bars for continuous radio streams.
- 🚫 **Radio Track Duration Handling**: Hide zero/null durations for radio tracks in tracklist to avoid confusion.
- ⚙ **Server-side Query Parsing Fixes**: Updated parsing to use `~` delimiter instead of `|||` and split ratings by spaces, syncing backend with frontend.
- ↕ **Sorting Parameters Enhancement**: Added `track_number` to sortable columns and split sorting into `sort_by` and `sort_dir` params for clarity.
