## üéß A Sonic Universe Under Your Control

<img align="right" src="media/network-sharing.png" alt="Network sharing" width="40%" height="auto">

Tired of streaming services that dictate your listening experience, inject ads, and rent you access to music you thought you owned? The **Synthwave Player** is a declaration of musical independence. It's not a service; it's ***your*** **open-source server**, its your music, your curation, and your unstoppable power.

Built for the discerning music lover who curates their own library, this player combines the convenience of web access with the power of self-hosting. De-cloud yourself and own your listening experience, without limits.

<br clear="right">


### üèÜ Why This Self-Hosted Player Beats Spotify


For real music lovers, a self-hosted player isn't just a preference‚Äîit's a necessity. Here‚Äôs why streaming services fall short:

-   **üëë Your full control:** Your music, your rules. No subscriptions, ads, limits or surprises. With no tracking data collection.
-   **üéß Your Personal Spotify, anywhere!:** Transform your music library into a private streaming service effortlessly. Get the Spotify experience with your own collection, no ads, no fees, no surprises, and complete privacy. - Is time to cancel your Spotify billing!
-   **üé® Beautiful Design & Unique UX:** Music is a sensorial experience, this player gives you in a unique user experience designed to immerse you in the music with the sole purpose to enjoy it.
-   **üé§ Automated Lyrics:** Sing along with synchronized, auto-scrolling lyrics found automatically from multiple sources. A premium feature on other platforms, free and standard here.
-   **üé§ For Music Creators:** Use it as your Music website. Publish your works-in-progress or finished masterpieces directly, bypassing corporate gatekeepers. You control the distribution and own the rights.
-   **üî≠ View-Based Tracklists:** Features a powerful view-based tracklist selection. Any view you create by filtering multiple genres, combining playlists, selected specific artists, or search results becomes a unique, perfectly shareable tracklist. This is a unique concept that never another music app had before.
-   **üîó Unmatched Sharability:** Share not just songs, but *moments*. Send a link to a track that starts at the exact second you want, or share a link to your custom-filtered 5-star 80s rock playlist.
-   **üéµ The Unfindable Tracks:** Mainstream services lack deep cuts, rare imports, remixes, and many game OSTs, and often replace original albums with modern "remasters." Self-hosting preserves the authentic sound of the specific version you own‚Äîif you have the file, you can play it.
-   **üëª No Vanishing Music:** Tracks on streaming services can disappear overnight due to licensing issues. Your personal library is permanent.
-   **üîä Uncompromised Audio Quality:** Stream your high-fidelity lossless files (like FLAC) without compromise or extra cost.
-   **üè∑Ô∏è Your Curation and Metadata:** Tired of seeing your meticulously tagged "Retrowave" tracks in a generic "Electronic" category? You control the tags, genres, ratings, and cover art, building the perfectly organized library you've always wanted.

## Download / Install

**NOTE:** If you just want to try the player üöÄ the quickest method is to simply download **[Elive Retrowave](https://www.elivecd.org/download/retrowave)** which ships with the player already pre-installed, configured, and with music ready to use.

<details>
<summary>
        <strong>Easy Installation</strong>
    </summary>

Go to the *Releases* section and download the latest `.deb` package for your system.

        <strong>Manual Installation</strong>
        <img align="center" alt="advanced" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Advanced-C73b3b">
    </summary>
### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

2.  **Install the required Perl modules.**

    You can use `cpanm` (you might need to install it first, e.g., `sudo apt-get install cpanminus`):
    ```bash
    sudo cpanm Mojolicious Net::UPnP XML::LibXML MP3::Tag File::HomeDir Digest::SHA Try::Tiny
    ```

    **Alternatively, for Debian 13 (Trixie) and derivatives:**
    You can install most dependencies directly from the system's package manager, which is often faster and better integrated.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libmojolicious-perl libnet-upnp-perl libxml-libxml-perl libmp3-tag-perl libfile-homedir-perl libdigest-sha-perl libtry-tiny-perl
    ```

3.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x synthwave-player
    ```

### Running the Server
There are several ways to run the player. For initial testing, it's best to run it in the foreground to watch for logs and errors.

**1. Foreground Mode (for testing)**
To see live log output, run the server in the foreground. It will run until you stop it with `Ctrl+C`.
```bash
hypnotoad --foreground synthwave-player
```

**2. Background Daemon Mode**
To start the player and have it run in the background, detached from your terminal:
```bash
hypnotoad synthwave-player
```
To stop the background server:
```bash
hypnotoad --stop synthwave-player
```

### Accessing the Player
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:8160` as it explains on the terminal logs. If running on your local machine, you can simply use `http://localhost:8160` or `http://127.0.0.1:8160`.

#### üì± Using as a Desktop App
For a more integrated desktop experience, you can run the player in its own window without browser toolbars. This makes it feel like a native application.

Replace the URL with your player's actual address. For local use, this is `http://localhost:8160`. If accessing over the network or internet, use your server's IP or domain name (e.g., `https://music.yourdomain.com`).

*   **Google Chrome / Chromium:**
    ```bash
    google-chrome --app="http://localhost:8160"
    ```
*   **Mozilla Firefox:**
    Firefox has a Site-Specific Browser (SSB) mode which can be launched via the terminal:
    ```bash
    firefox --ssb "http://localhost:8160"
    ```
*   **Surf (Minimalist Browser):**
    For an extremely lightweight option, you can use `surf`. IMPORTANT: depending on the version and your system's webkit libraries, you may encounter rendering or audio playback issues.
    ```bash
    surf "http://localhost:8160"
    ```

    </summary>
<br>
While you can access the player by its IP address on your local network, setting it up with a domain name, a reverse proxy, and SSL encryption provides a more professional, secure, and convenient experience. Here‚Äôs a complete guide for setting this up on a Debian 13 (Trixie) server.

> **üöÄ Pro Tip for Servers:** If you're setting this up on a dedicated server, consider using **[Elive for Servers](https://www.elivecd.org/premium/elive-for-servers/)**. It's a tool that enhances your existing Debian/Ubuntu server with the amazing Elive shell, automated TMUX sessions, and optional installers for a highly optimized Nginx, security tools (like Fail2ban), and more. It can automate much of the setup below in just a few minutes.

---

#### Step 1: Get a Domain Name & Point it to Your Server

You need a domain or subdomain pointed to your server's public IP address.

**If you have a dynamic IP address** (common for home connections), you can use a free dynamic DNS service.
1.  Sign up at a service like [freedns.afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org/).
2.  Create a subdomain (e.g., `my-music.us.to`).
3.  They will provide you with a unique URL to update your IP. Set up a cron job to run every 5 minutes to keep your IP updated.
    -   Open your crontab: `crontab -e`
    -   Add this line, replacing the URL with your unique one:
        ```bash
        */5 * * * * curl -s "https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN_HERE" > /dev/null 2>&1
        ```

#### Step 2: Install and Configure Nginx with SSL

Nginx will act as a reverse proxy, securely forwarding traffic from the standard web port (443) to the player application (running on port 8160). This guide also covers setting up a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

1.  **Install Nginx and Certbot:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nginx certbot
    ```

2.  **Create an Nginx configuration file** for your site. Replace `music.yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/music.yourdomain.com
    ```

3.  **Paste this configuration into the file.** It sets up an SSL-secured reverse proxy that redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and enables WebSocket support.
    ```nginx
    # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name music.yourdomain.com;

        location / {
            return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }
    }

    # Serve the application over HTTPS
    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        server_name music.yourdomain.com;

        # These paths are managed by Certbot. Make sure they exist after running certbot.
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/music.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/music.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

        # Recommended SSL settings from Certbot/Mozilla.
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

        location / {
            # Forward requests to your Perl application
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8160;

            # Set headers for WebSocket support and to pass client info
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

4.  **Enable the new site:**
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/music.yourdomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```

5.  **Obtain the SSL Certificate.** You must have Nginx stopped for Certbot's `standalone` mode to work.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop nginx
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d music.yourdomain.com
    ```
    Certbot will automatically set up a cron job to renew the certificate.

6.  **Generate a strong Diffie-Hellman group** for added security.
    ```bash
    sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem 2048
    ```

7.  **Test the configuration and start Nginx:**
    ```bash
    sudo nginx -t
    ```
    If the test is successful, start Nginx:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```
    Your server is now configured! You can access your music securely at `https://music.yourdomain.com`.

#### Step 3: Make the Player Run Persistently

To ensure the player starts on boot and runs continuously, you can use a cron job or a `systemd` service. The `systemd` method is more robust as it can automatically restart the player if it crashes.

**Option A: Auto-start with Cron (Simple)**

A cron job can start the player at boot. This is easy to set up but won't restart a crashed server.

1.  Open your user's crontab for editing:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2.  Add the following line, making sure to use the absolute path to the script.
    ```bash
    @reboot hypnotoad /home/your_username/path/to/music-player/synthwave-player
    ```

**Option B: Run as a Systemd Service (Recommended)**

This is the most reliable way to run the player as a long-term service. The player comes with a pre-configured `systemd` user service.

1.  **Enable user lingering:**
    To ensure the server runs even when you are not logged in, you must enable lingering for your user account. Replace `your_username` with your actual username.
    ```bash
    sudo loginctl enable-linger your_username
    ```

2.  **Enable and start the service:**
    To start the server immediately and have it automatically start on every boot, run the following command (as your user, not root):
    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable --now synthwave-player-server.service
    ```

3.  **Check the service status:**
    You can verify that the service is running correctly with:
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status synthwave-player-server.service
    ```
Your server is now fully configured! You can access your music securely at `https://music.yourdomain.com`.


<strong>üçì How to build a music server on a Raspberry Pi</strong>
<br>
A Raspberry Pi is an excellent choice for a low-power, energy-efficient, and always-on music server. Since Raspberry Pi OS is based on Debian, you can follow the main installation instructions.

The only specific consideration for a Raspberry Pi is the location of your music library. If you store your music on an external USB drive, you will need to edit the `@MUSIC_DIRECTORIES` variable from the tool, personal configurations, or interface configurations to include the path to your drive (e.g., `/media/pi/MyMusicDrive`).

-   **Video Player:** A companion video player with a similar synthwave aesthetic and feature set, including animated thumbnails.
-   **Peer-to-Peer Sharing:** Build shareable music libraries with friends over peer-to-peer connections, directly integrated with yours!
-   **User Authentication:** Optional username/password protection to restrict access to your player.
-   **User Statistics:** Track listening habits and see stats on a per-user basis.
-   **User-based liked system**: Allow users to like (hearth) the songs, saving them in ther username login, and display the total ratings average too.
-   **Windows / MacOS / Docker Support:** Set up this player running it from a docker so you can install it on windows or mac too.
-   **UI**: The disc should not spin, but instead it should remain in place and rotate a few pixels back and forth to simulate the record spinning. This will require to separate the reflection with the disc image (2 images), the disc should spin and the reflection should whobble back-and-forth
